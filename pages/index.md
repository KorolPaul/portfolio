What can a “full-stack web developer” do, you ask?

I can conjur a website from nothing into existence, fully formed. I do not use tricks, nor is this magic. I specialize in manipulating the very fabric of the web, its raw materials of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG. Linux servers serve me, domains are my domain, and certificates are certain.
